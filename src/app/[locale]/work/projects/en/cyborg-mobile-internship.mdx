## Overview
At Cyborg Mobile, I contributed to developing a sophisticated chatbot system that leverages the OpenAI Assistants API. The project focused on enhancing application engagement and providing personalized learning experiences for students.

## Key Features
- Custom LLM implementation using OpenAI's GPT-4
- RESTful API architecture for seamless data flow
- Firebase integration for robust data management
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementation for grant-writing assistance
- Scalable backend supporting 80+ concurrent users

## Technical Implementation
- Built frontend components using React and TypeScript
- Developed RESTful APIs using Node.js
- Implemented Firebase for real-time data synchronization
- Integrated OpenAI Assistants API with custom fine-tuning

## Challenges & Learning
- Optimizing response times for real-time chat interactions
- Implementing secure data handling practices
- Fine-tuning the model for specific use cases
- Scaling the system to handle multiple concurrent users

## Impact
The project significantly improved user engagement and provided valuable learning support for students while maintaining high performance and reliability standards.
